Absolutely, let's dive into these SQL commands and functions as you would use them in **iSQL*Plus**:

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
1. **CREATE**: Creates a new table.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE students (
        student_id NUMBER,
        first_name VARCHAR2(50),
        last_name VARCHAR2(50),
        birth_date DATE
    );
    ```
   
2. **DESC (DESCRIBE)**: Describes the structure of a table.
    ```sql
    DESC students;
    ```

3. **INSERT**: Adds a new row to a table.
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name, birth_date)
    VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', TO_DATE('1990-01-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
    ```

4. **SELECT**: Retrieves data from a table.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM students;
    ```

5. **ALTER**: Modifies an existing table (e.g., adds a new column).
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE students ADD (email VARCHAR2(100));
    ```

6. **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions.
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE students;
    ```

7. **RENAME**: Renames a table.
    ```sql
    RENAME students TO pupils;
    ```

8. **DROP**: Deletes a table.
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE pupils;
    ```

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
1. **INSERT**: Adds new rows to a table (covered above).
2. **UPDATE**: Modifies existing rows in a table.
    ```sql
    UPDATE students SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE student_id = 1;
    ```

3. **DELETE**: Removes rows from a table.
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 1;
    ```

4. **SELECT**: Queries data from the database (covered above).

### Aggregate Functions
1. **DISTINCT**: Selects unique values.
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT last_name FROM students;
    ```

2. **AVG()**: Calculates the average value.
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(student_id) FROM students;
    ```

3. **SUM()**: Sums up values.
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(student_id) FROM students;
    ```

4. **MAX()**: Retrieves the maximum value.
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM students;
    ```

5. **MIN()**: Retrieves the minimum value.
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM students;
    ```

6. **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows.
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
    ```

These examples should give you a good understanding of how to use these SQL commands and functions in **iSQL*Plus**. Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further explanations!
